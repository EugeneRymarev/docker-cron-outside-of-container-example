# Creating a container for cron jobs outside of the container

This is an example of how to create a docker container to run scheduled commands
using the crontab on other containers.

If you just need a container to run jobs that do not need to interact with other containers, I recommand you to have a look at my other repopsitory [docker-cron-example](https://github.com/JulienD/docker-cron-example).

Also known as DooD (Docker outside of Docker), I have implementeed this by the past when playing with continous integration systems that used docker to run applications. The basic idea of DooD is to access the hostâ€™s Docker installation from within the container. Basically, we link the docker socket (/var/run/docker.sock) and the binary file to the cron container using the -v flag.

You can run it using the following commands:

    $ docker build -t docker-cron-ooc-example .

    $ docker run -it \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
    -v $(which docker):/usr/bin/docker
    --name my-docker-cron-ooc \
    docker-cron-ooc-example

Few minutes after having started the container you should see something similar to this:

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                     COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
6b34d62ea3f0        docker-cron-ooc-example   "/run-crond.sh"     47 seconds ago      Up 46 seconds                           cron-ooc-example
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                     COMMAND             CREATED              STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
6b34d62ea3f0        docker-cron-ooc-example   "/run-crond.sh"     About a minute ago   Up About a minute                       cron-ooc-example
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                     COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
6b34d62ea3f0        docker-cron-ooc-example   "/run-crond.sh"     2 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes                            cron-ooc-example
```

In order to interact with Docker on the host, we need to pass

## Using environment variables

Once the simple cron job is working, the main goal was to access environment variables in the command. For the example a simple "hello $world" is displayed but you may want to use variables inside a script. Unfortunately, the command executed by cron had not access to the container's environment variables. Thanks to this useful [stackoverflow thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26822067/running-cron-python-jobs-within-docker) who gave me the solution who show me how to inject variables to the crontab file.

 The following command included in [run-crond.sh](run-crond.sh) loads all the environment variables, gets the one starting with ENV_, combine them at the top of the /tmp/crontab file and finally move the result to /etc/cron.d/crontab

    env | egrep '^ENV_' | cat - /tmp/crontab > /etc/cron.d/crontab

Add env variable to the docker run command to make use of them:

    $ docker run -it -e ENV_NAME=f00 docker-cron-ooc-example

This should output you the following log.

```
Hello f00
Hello f00
Hello f00
```

## Accessing to the logs

You can access to the crontab output by running docker logs on your container

    $ docker run -d -e ENV_NAME=f00 docker-cron-ooc-example
    $ docker logs <container_name>
    hello f00
    hello f00    

## The Dockerfile

```
FROM gliderlabs/alpine:3.5

MAINTAINER "Julien Dubreuil"

COPY crontab /tmp/crontab

COPY run-crond.sh /run-crond.sh
RUN chmod -v +x /run-crond.sh

RUN mkdir -p /var/log/cron && touch /var/log/cron/cron.log

CMD ["/run-crond.sh"]
```

1. The FROM command specify our base image. It used a alpine on steroids image as our base image.

3. Next, we copy the crontab file to the /tmp directory of the container in order to make it available as declared in the run-crond.sh file.

3. Then, we copy the crontab run script to the container and make it executable.

4. We Create a default log file for the cron job.

5. Finally, we specify the command that container will execute on startup.
